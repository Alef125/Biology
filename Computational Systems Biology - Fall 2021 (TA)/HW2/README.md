# CSB - HW2
In this homework, we study different kinds of reaction couplings in a metabolic network. Regardless of the biological intuition behind the couplings, these relations help us speed up exponential-time MILP problems in metabolic networks, including the most important problems in this field. After that, we will use QFCA to find a quantitative equation for a flux according to a proper set of irreversible fluxes. 
(The solution folder is empty now and would be filled after the deadline for this homework.)
