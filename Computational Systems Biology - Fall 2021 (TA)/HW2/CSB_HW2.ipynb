    "In this homework, you study different kinds of reaction couplings in a metabolic network. Regardless of the biological intuition behind the couplings, these relations help us speed up exponential-time MILP problems in metabolic networks, including the most important problems in this field. After that, you will use QFCA to find a quantitative equation for a flux according to a proper set of irreversible fluxes."

Compare the result to irreversible essential reactions and save the reactions which belong to one of these sets and not the other (i.e., the essential reactions which are not directionally coupled to biomass and vice versa). Be careful to consider off_reactions in aerobic conditions like in HW1. \n",

    "**Note:** Your equivalent LP can be in a different format than an FBA problem (but it shouldn't be drastically different!). It is not compulsory to use the COBRA toolbox for solving your LP problem, but here are some hints to keep using it. You learned how to add new variables to the model (dummy reaction is also a choice). To add any constraints to your model, you can use `new_constraint = model.problem.Constraint(rxn.flux_expression, lb=min_val, ub=max_val)` (one of the `lb` or `ub` arguments could be ignored or set to `None`), then `model.add_cons_vars([new_constraint])`. Review the tutorial in HW1 for more details. If any of your reaction variables do not contain lower and upper bounds, simply set those bounds to great negative and positive values. Consider `M = 1000000` or any greater number as infinity wherever necessary."
