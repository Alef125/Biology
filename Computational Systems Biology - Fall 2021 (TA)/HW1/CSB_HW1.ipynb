For exchange reactions, all have an upper-bound equal to $M=1000$. The lower bounds are set to $0$, else for the metabolites available in the growth medium. In our special medium, called the M9 medium, there exists a limited glucose uptake, which is demonstrated by lower-bound(EX_glc(e)) = $-10$ in the model. Also, as we have assumed to be in an aerobic condition, the oxygen uptake has been set to $20$ (i.e., lower-bound(EX_o2(e)) = $-20$). Other lower-bounds for external reactions are set to $-M$, as there are supposed to be available in excess in our medium. You don't need to change any of these bounds in this section, but as extra information, there are some reactions in the aerobic condition which cannot carry any flux due to the regulatory constraints and are presented in the `\"iAF1260_off_reactions_aero.txt\"` file. Be careful to set their fluxes to zero in the aerobic condition."
